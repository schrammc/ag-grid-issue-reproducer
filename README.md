# Ag-Grid issue reproducer

## Purpose

I think ag-grid cell selection behavior currently does not work with react-testing-library. 
This is a reproducer for these issues with some tests that should pass but don't.

## Setup

This requires an ag-grid enterprise license key in GridComponent.tsx please drop yours in

## Run tests

```
npm run test
```

## Expected behavior

In my opinion all these tests should pass.
